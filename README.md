# Eliq-drinks-app
Your home assignment is to write a simple drinks app. It has two main screens. The first screen should show the list of drinks with the image and name of the drink. You can fetch the data from: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=Alcoholic

The second screen is a ‘details’ page explaining the drink recipe. It includes: An image with name, ingredients and list of instructions in different languages which the API supports. You can fetch the data from: https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i={The-id-of-drink}

**Note**: Develop this project in WLA (White-Label App) approach. A WLA drinks app which could be branded and configured by a config .json file. Think of this config .json object as an instruction which tells the app what/where/how to populate the UI elements. Think like you are developing a WL app template.

# Design and Architecture
There are no requirements as to what architecture you should choose. We recommend you choose the architecture you're most comfortable with. Also feel free to use your favorite open source libraries. Be creative with the design, you are free to decide how to create the UI and UX.

# Delivery
In your fork, delete this content from the current README.md and instead document your project and explain how UI elements can be managed/altered through the Json object - this is also a good way to share thoughts on your design decisions and trade-offs you made.

Additionally, deploy the final compiled version of the app to github pages and provide the URL to it.

Good luck!
